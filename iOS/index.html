          <h1>iOS Work</h1>
          <p>Here's a small collection of projects I've built for iOS.</p>
        </div>

            <h1>Delio</h1>
            <img class="project-image" src="./assets/images/delio/site.png">
            <div class="caption">The Delio landing page</div>
            <p>Delio is the company and app that <a href="http://drewmacneil.com">Drew</a> and I founded and built as members of <a href="http://www.thenext36.ca">The Next 36</a>'s 2014 cohort. Our aim was to create the easiest way for young adults to learn how to cook. I designed and developed v1.0 of the universal iOS app, and conducted a private beta test to validate product/market fit.</p>
            <p>The problem that we identified was that many young adults cannot cook, but not because of a lack of effort. Existing resources often assumed a baseline knowledge that many of them didn't have. This, among other problems, discouraged would-be cooks.</p>
            <p>To solve this, Delio was designed to make cooking as simple as possible. Delio breaks recipes down into a series of short videos, each depicting a single, easily replicable action. </p>
            <p>Delio was shut down following the completion of a private beta with over 100 users. Following the shut down, we decided to open source the code for the app - go ahead and give it a read!</p>

            </div>
            <p>Blynk is a company and app that provides users with their own personal, virtual stylist. Co-founded by two great friends of mine, <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/shumskassam">Shums</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaclynling">Jaclyn</a>, I had the opportunity to work with them briefly conducting a comprehensive overhaul of their iOS app.</p>
            <p>I conceptualized and implemented several new features, including a social following and recommendation system, a new notification system, and a commenting system. The goal of these features was to increase the stickiness of the experience.</p>
            <p>I also redesigned the app, simplifying the core experience while also adding new features. The main focus was on simplicity; unnecessary chrome and buttons were removed from the home screen, making way for a new, global menu. This greatly simplified navigation through the app and allowed for the inclusion of more complex features.</p>
            <p>Blynk was recently acquired by Kik (December 2015).</p>
